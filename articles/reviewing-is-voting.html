              <h3 id="before-you-begin">ON CHOOSING PRs TO REVIEW</h3>

              <p>
                Reviewing is not only the most effective way to contribute as a
                new contributor, it is also a powerful form of voting. Just as
                what we buy and do every day is the strongest way we can vote
                and cumulatively influence things, our choices here matter
                profoundly and cumulatively.
              </p>
              <h4 id="the-current-state-of-affairs">The Current State of Affairs</h4>
              <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls"
                   target="_blank">Several hundred pull requests</a>
                are open at any given moment in Bitcoin Core waiting for review
                and testing, and the stack continues to grow higher -- 280 in
                November 2019, 350 at the end of January 2020!
              </p>
              <p>
                Review is currently not keeping pace with PRs and issues (the
                latter are also up to nearly 800, from 700 a few months
                ago).
              </p>
              <p>
                Worse, the PRs that tend to get reviewed and merged quickly are
                the trivial, the easiest to review, and the newest.  Valuable,
                high-priority PRs can be seen sitting for months or even years
                without enough reviewers, subjecting their authors to
                frustration, discouragement, and rebase hell until they abandon
                working on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The number of experienced people doing good, consistent review
                is surprisingly low. When I describe the situation to people,
                even to established VCs in the Bitcoin space, they tend to be
                astonished at how few people the system is depending on.
              </p>
              <p>
                On any given day, you'll see the same 10-20 people reviewing on
                a daily basis. Of these, maybe half have the experience and
                available time/finances/predisposition for tackling review of
                the harder or larger PRs. That leaves roughly 10 consistent,
                experienced reviewers. The other half of the regular reviewers
                are reviewing the easier or more trivial PRs in their spare
                time.
              </p>
              <h4 id="current-issues">Current Issues</h4>
              <p>
                This state of affairs creates several problems:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    High-priority, larger, or harder-to-review PRs can go for
                    months (and even years) without sufficient review.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Smaller PRs that provide important, non-urgent prevention,
                    adding missing test coverage, tend to sit for months without
                    review or being merged.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Review and merges sometimes go to the squeaky wheel.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Less-loud PR authors are incentivised to open more trivial
                    and smaller PRs that have a better chance of being reviewed
                    and merged within a reasonable time (until the author tires
                    of making this sort of contribution and aspires to greater
                    things, before being discouraged again by the current state
                    of affairs). Any PR beyond a fairly small size or low level
                    of complexity needs to be separated into bite-sized PRs that
                    are easier to review.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Things tend to be abandoned or never quite finished. Some
                    contributors leave or take long periods of absence from the
                    project out of frustration. Other shake it off but feel
                    recurring discouragement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Of course, managing context, relevance, and building review
                    alliances can make a huge difference. Bitcoin Core code
                    reviews arguably represent a micro-economy of sorts. Getting
                    your PRs reviewed without being annoying (preferably mainly
                    by helping others and doing consistent review yourself) can
                    be an art.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Nevertheless, we're running a continual risk of
                    mal-investment â€” scarce review resources squandered on the
                    wrong things rather than catching a regression or
                    vulnerability, fixing issues, improving test coverage,
                    finishing up ongoing work that was has needed follow-ups,
                    doing long-term work, and other priorities.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Above all, not enough of the contributors do consistent
                    review or follow the practice of 5-15 reviews or issues
                    handled per PR opened.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <h4 id="reviewing-is-voting">Reviewing is Voting</h4>
              <p>
                Given this state of affairs, clearly, which PRs we review with
                our limited time is an important choice, and one that might be
                underappreciated.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PRs we review represent:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    what areas we contribute to
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    which project priorities matter to us
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    what kind of PRs we incentivise
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ultimately, which behaviors we reward
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Nowadays, I pay a considerable amount of attention to
                consciously choosing the right PRs to review. Here are my
                current criteria:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What: high-priority, higher-value, harder PRs over
                    new/easy/trivial/annoying ones (knowing that they will see
                    review anyway) unless they are urgent, interesting, or an
                    area I know well.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Who: I want to reward people who do quality review or
                    issue-testing, *particularly* if they are professional
                    Bitcoin Core contributors, e.g. receiving a steady salary to
                    work on Bitcoin open source.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Sure, coding is more fun than reviewing. but reviewing is too
                vital here, and when i see poorly-done PRs I keep thinking,
                maybe too much, about the review resources they might be taking
                away from catching a regression or CVE.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hopefully the review club can help encourage more reviewing but
                i'm thinking about how else we can encourage it, add incentives
                or social norms maybe, etc. These are good things to think
                about.
              </p>
              <h4 id="what-to-do">What To Do</h4>
              <p>
                Continue to do more reviewing and testing than adding PRs to the
                backlog. Reviewing 5 to 15 PRs for every PR you open is a good
                range. Communicate that norm to people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Choose PRs to review carefully. Don't squander time, diligence
                and care on the technical equivalent of junk food. Don't reward
                half-done PRs, and don't incentivise non-exceptional PRs added
                to the stack by authors who aren't giving back by reviewing
                consistently and commensurately.
              </p>
              <p>
              </p>
              <p>
                Happy contributing!
