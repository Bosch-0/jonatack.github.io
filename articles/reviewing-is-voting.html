              <h3 id="before-you-begin">ON CHOOSING PRs TO REVIEW</h3>

              <p>
                Reviewing is not only the most effective way to contribute as a
                new contributor, it is also a powerful form of voting. Just as
                what we buy and do every day is the strongest way we can vote
                and cumulatively influence things, our choices here matter
                profoundly and cumulatively.
              </p>
              <h4 id="the-current-state-of-affairs">The Current State of Affairs</h4>
              <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls"
                   target="_blank">Several hundred pull requests</a>
                are open at any given moment in Bitcoin Core waiting for review
                and testing, and the stack continues to grow higher -- 280 in
                November 2019, 350 at the end of January 2020!
              </p>
              <p>
                Review is currently not keeping pace with PRs and issues (the
                latter are also up to nearly 800, from 700 a few months
                ago). Worse, the PRs that tend to get reviewed and merged
                quickly are the trivial, the easiest to review, and the newest.
                Valuable, high-priority PRs can be seen sitting for months or
                even years without enough reviewers, subjecting their authors to
                frustration, discouragement, and rebase hell until they abandon
                working on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The number of experienced people doing good, consistent review
                is surprisingly low. When I describe the situation to people,
                even to established VCs in the Bitcoin space, they tend to be
                astonished at how few people the system is depending on.
              </p>
              <p>
                On any given day, you'll see the same 10-20 people reviewing on
                a daily basis. Of these, maybe half have the experience and
                available time/finances/predisposition for tackling review of
                the harder or larger PRs. That leaves roughly 10 consistent,
                experienced reviewers. The other half of the regular reviewers
                are reviewing the easier or more trivial PRs in their spare
                time.
              </p>

              <p>
                This state of affairs creates several problems:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    High-priority, larger, or harder-to-review PRs can go for
                    months (and even years) without sufficient review.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    PRs that provide important prevention but that are
                    non-urgent, like
                    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17535"
                       target="_blank">adding missing test coverage</a>,
                    tend to sit for months without review or being merged.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    PR authors are incentivised to either leave the project out
                    of frustration, or more often, open trivial and small PRs
                    that have a chance of being reviewed and merged within the
                    year (until the author tires of making this sort of
                    contribution and aspires to greater things, before being
                    discouraged again by the current state of affairs).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We're running a continual risk of mal-investment -- of review
                resources going into minutae rather than catching a regression
                or vulnerablity, or other important priorities.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <h4 id="reviewing-is-voting">Reviewing is Voting</h4>
              <p>
                Given this state of affairs, clearly, which PRs we review with
                our limited time is an important choice, and one that might be
                underappreciated.
              </p>
              <p>
                The PRs we review represent:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    which areas we decide to contribute to
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    which project priorities matter to us
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    which authors we help
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    which kind of PRs we incentivise
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Nowadays, I pay a considerable amount of attention to
                consciously choosing the right PRs to review. Here are my
                current criteria:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What: high-priority, higher-value, harder PRs over
                    new/easy/trivial/annoying ones (knowing that they will see
                    review anyway) unless they are urgent, interesting, or an
                    area I know well
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Who: PRs by people who also review PRs or test issues
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                sure, coding is more fun than reviewing. but reviewing is too
                vital here, and when i see trivial PRs i keep thinking, maybe
                too much, about the review resources they might be taking away
                from catching a regression or CVE
              </p>
              <p>
                hopefully this review club can help encourage more reviewing but
                i'm thinking about how else we can encourage it, add incentives
                or social norms maybe, etc. these are good things to think about.
              </p>
              <h4 id="what-to-do">What To Do</h4>
              <p>
                Choose your reviews carefully! Don't squander time and social
                capital on the technical equivalent of junk food.
              </p>
              <p>
                Continue to do more reviewing and testing than adding PRs to the
                backlog. Reviewing 5 to 15 PRs for every PR you open is a good
                range.
              </p>
              <p>
              </p>
              <p>
                Happy contributing!
