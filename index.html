    <u><i>Background</i></u>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    I began programming at age 9 in BASIC and assembly language. Since age 15, I
    have been a freelance software engineer for companies like Electronic Arts,
    L'Oreal, Group SEB/Moulinex, the Paris Airports, and France Electricity, and
    have been an open source contributor

    (<a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/"
        target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Top 100</a>) and author/maintainer,
    <a href="https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/graphs/contributors"
       target="_blank">notably</a>

    of

    <a href="https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack/" target="_blank">Ransack</a>,

    the leading Ruby search engine, but also

    <a href="https://github.com/jonatack/kraken_ruby_client" target="_blank">Kraken Ruby Client</a>,

    an API client for the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange featured in the

    <a href="https://www.kraken.com/features/api#example-api-code"
       target="_blank">Kraken API documentation</a>.

    I studied Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College in the US, followed by an
    MBA at INSEAD in France. I also have 2 years of marketing brand management
    experience in consumer products at L'Oreal and speak English, French, and
    German.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div>
    In March 2019, I began learning to contribute to Bitcoin Core. I started by
    studying the repository and the social process and specific technical
    details of contributing to the project. I've been compiling and curating
    this knowledge at
    <a href="https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development"
       target="_= blank">https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development</a>,
    which is frequently recommended to other developers like in this
    <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1177251272560394240"
       target="_blank">Bitcoin Magazine</a>
    <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-want-to-learn-about-bitcoin-try-the-bitcoin-core-pr-review-club"
       target="_blank">September 2019 article</a>
    and is becoming an educational resource.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div>
    It became clear that what is most needed and useful, and paradoxically the
    least done by new Bitcoin Core contributors, is review and testing of PRs
    and issues. Roughly 300 pull requests and 700 issues are open at any given
    moment in Bitcoin Core waiting for experienced review and testing.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div>
    I rapidly became one of the most active new contributors and
    reviewers on Bitcoin Core, as well as on
    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoi= nops/bitcoinops.github.io"
       target="_blank">Bitcoin Optech</a>,

    reviewing each week's newsletter by Dave Harding with John Newbery, Mike
    Schmidt, Steve Hall, and Adam Jonas, and for the

    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io" target="_blank">Bitcoin Core PR Review Club</a>,
    helping John Newbery with
    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/graphs/contributors"
       target="_blank">improving the codebase and website</a>,
    <a href="https://bitcoincore.reviews/16401.html"
       target="_blank">hosting meetings</a>,
    and creating and running the
    <a href="https://twitter.= com/BitcoinCorePRs"
       target="_blank">BitcoinCorePRs twitter account</a>.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div>
    In early June, Adam Jonas and John Newbery invited me to attend the
    Chaincode Labs residency seminars. I spent 2 weeks in the Chaincode Labs
    Manhattan office learning about Bitcoin and meeting core developers and the
    summer residents. Since then, I have been contributing part-time in the
    evenings and weekends. Bitcoin Core maintainers and developers frequently
    ask me for review, testing or a fix as if I were full-time on Bitcoin Core.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div>
    Opening pull requests has not been a priority of mine. Yet, by reviewing
    and understanding what needs to be done and how to make contributions easy
    to review, I have had
    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits=?author=jonatack"
       target="_blank">33 commits merged into Bitcoin Core</a>

    -- more than any other new contributor this year to Bitcoin Core. I am
    currently

    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors"
       target="_blank">#40 of the Bitcoin Core all-time
      contributors</a>

    and in the top 10-15 among the currently active contributors. Every
    Bitcoin Core commit I have made has been merged -- a merge rate of
    100%. This shows effectiveness in having improvements merged.
  </div>

  <br>
  <div>
    While reviewing, I found and fixed several Bitcoin Core bugs and
    regressions. Here's the most recent example (I can pick on John since he
    is incredibly well-respected and a great guy): The
    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16866"
       target="_blank">regression</a>,
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16873" target="_blank">my fix</a>.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div>
    I regularly attend the weekly Bitcoin Core IRC meetings and bi-weekly
    wallet team IRC meetings, and hosted my first Bitcoin Core wallet team IRC
    meeting recently; here are links to the
    <a href="http://www.erisian.com.au/meetbot/bitcoin-core-dev/2019/bitcoin-core-dev.2019-09-27-19.03.html"

    <b>Future work in more detail:</b>
  </div>

  <br>

  <div>
    I plan to prioritise my time to Bitcoin roughly as follows:<br>
    <br>
    Robustness > Privacy > Features > Scaling > UI.<br>
    <br>
    Thus <b>robustness, censorship resistance, and privacy</b> are my highest
    priorities.
  </div>

  <br><br>

  <div>
    Goals:
  </div>

  <br>

  <div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Strengthening Bitcoin Core's <b>decentralisation</b>, <b>censorship
          resistance</b> and <b>privacy</b> by working to improve
        the <b>peer-to-peer network privacy</b> and resistance to surveillance
        and attacks, working with and helping Jonas Schnelli, Suhas Daftuar,
        Gleb Naumenko, and other people like the Chaincode residents I met this
        summer, particularly James Chiang and Antoine Riard who have some good
        ideas.
        <br><br>
        Examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            V2 P2P message protocol with opportunistic encryption (BIP 324, BIP
            150) by Jonas Schnelli, which was the subject of a
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o6PaA-vAWXhpCHHbBkUGZJ-6bmde6gEY/view"
               target="_blank">presentation I made at Chaincode Labs</a>
            and a Bitcoin Core PR Review meeting
            <a href="https://bitcoin-core-review-club.github.io/16202.html"
               target="_blank">I hosted with Bitcoin Core maintainer Jonas Schnelli</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Multiple P2P networks instead of just one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Possibly different IP buckets per peer; each IP would have its own
            AddrMan table and would confer to ensure they don' have the same peer
            IPs, to avoid IP poisoning e.g. flooding by attacker peers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Package Relay, separating block relay from transaction relay into 2
            networks. Suhas Daftuar is working on this; it will need extensive
            review and improvements/counter-proposals.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve our p2p simulation/network testing frameworks to better
            understand the multi-order effects of proposed improvements.
          </li>
          <li>
            A better framework for systematically thinking about privacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Better simulations needed for evaluating proposals like
            Dandelion/++/Lite and others.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        Increasing Bitcoin Core's <b>robustness</b>: finding and fixing
        regressions and bugs, and adding missing test coverage and better
        testing in under-utilised areas like the P2P network, fuzzing, and
        <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16645"
           target="_blank">property-based testing (which I've
          helped introduce into Bitcoin Core)</a>.

        Robustness can also mean working on codebase performance, modularity and
        multiprocess.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        The number one bottleneck in Bitcoin Core is <b>experienced
          review</b> of difficult PRs. I would dedicate more time to <b>deep
          review</b> of the important PRs that often sit for months without
        enough review to be merged and have to go through multiple painful
        rebases, which blocks vital progress and demotivates experienced
        long-term contributors from working on Bitcoin Core.
        <ul>
          <li>
            I would unblock these critical PRs by reviewing them and
            by <b>coordinating</b> with the maintainers and other contributors to
            ensure timely review where it is most needed and difficult.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reviewing also means continuing to find and fix regressions and bugs
            throughout Bitcoin Core and making it more <b>robust</b>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        Improving the Bitcoin Core <b>wallet</b> features, user (GUI)
        interface, RPC interface, connectivity with hardware wallets, and
        security.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        Investing in <b>developer education</b> and awareness of code review
        via the Bitcoin Core PR Review Club, and possibly continued review or
        work with Bitcoin Optech:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Develop the Bitcoin Core PR Review Club website and promotion with John
            Newbery
          </li>
          <li>
            Host Bitcoin Core PR Review Club meetings, like
            <a href="https://bitcoincore.reviews/16202.html"
               target="_blank">here</a>,
            and
            <a href="https://bitcoincore.reviews/16401.html"
               target="_blank">here</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop a backend for the
            <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinCorePRs"
               target="_blank">BitcoinCorePRs twitter account</a>
            to live-tweet Bitcoin Core reviews, high-priority PR
            updates, and publish monthly rankings of the most
            active Bitcoin Core reviewers
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue reviewing the <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/"
                                      target="_blank">Bitcoin Optech newsletters</a> and perhaps other actions
            to help Dave Harding, John Newbery, and Mike Schmidt.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        Regularly presenting the results of the above work at conferences and
        meetups, providing training, and where feasible, ethically adding value
        for my sponsor or employer.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        Longer term, possibly evolving towards a <b>maintainer role</b> in
        Bitcoin Core. It fits my profile and experience, there will always be a
        need, and it takes years to cultivate a maintainer in a project like
        this.
