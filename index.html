                I began programming at age 9 in BASIC and assembly

                engineer for companies like Electronic Arts, L'Oréal, Group
                SEB/Moulinex, the Paris Airports, and France Electricity, and
                have been an open source contributor

              </p>
              <p>
                I studied Computer Science at

                  addition to software engineering, I have 2 years of marketing

              </p>
              <p>
                In March 2019, I started learning to contribute to Bitcoin Core,
                beginning with studying the repository and the social process
                and technical details of contributing to the project. I've been
                compiling and curating this knowledge at
                <a href="https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development"
                   target="_blank">https://github.com/jonatack/bitcoin-development</a>,

              </p>
              <p>
                It became clear that what is most needed and useful, and
                paradoxically the least done by new contributors, is review and
                testing of PRs and issues. More than
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls"
                target="_blank">300 pull requests</a>
                and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues"
                target="_blank">700 issues</a> are open at any given moment in
                Bitcoin Core waiting for experienced review and testing, and the
                amount continues to increase. The maintainers need help!

                I rapidly became one of the most active contributors and
                reviewers on Bitcoin Core, as well as on
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinops/bitcoinops.github.io"
                   target="_blank">Bitcoin Optech</a>,

                In early June, Adam Jonas and John Newbery invited me to attend
                the <a href="https://chaincode.com/" target="_blank">Chaincode
                Labs</a> summer residency Bitcoin seminars. I spent 2 weeks in
                the Chaincode Labs Manhattan office learning about Bitcoin and
                meeting core developers and the summer residents — an amazing
                experience.

                Opening pull requests has not been a priority of mine. Yet, as a
                by-product of reviewing, seeing what needs to be done, and
                understanding how to make contributions easy to review, I have
                had
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commits=?author=jonatack"
                   target="_blank">53 commits merged into Bitcoin Core</a>, more
                than any other new contributor in 2019 to Bitcoin Core. I am
                currently
                <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors"
                   target="_blank">#34 of the Bitcoin Core all-time
                   contributors</a> and in the top 10 among the currently active
                   contributors. Nearly every Bitcoin Core commit I have made
                   has been merged. This shows effectiveness in having
                   improvements merged.
              </p>
              <p>
                While reviewing, I have caught a fair number of Bitcoin Core
                bugs and regressions before they were merged, and found and
                fixed a few afterwards as well.

              <div class="title">Future work in detail</div>
              <p>
                I plan to prioritise my time to Bitcoin roughly as follows:
              </p>
              <h3>Robustness > Privacy > Features > Scaling > UI</h3>
              <p>
                Robustness and privacy/censorship resistance are therefore my
                highest priorities.
              </p>
              <h3>Goals</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Dedicating time to <b>deep review</b> of the important, criti
                  PRs that often sit for months without enough review to be
                  merged and have to go through multiple painful rebases, which
                  blocks vital progress and demotivates experienced long-term
                  contributors from working on Bitcoin Core.<br>
                  <br>
                  The number one bottleneck in Bitcoin Core is <b>experienced
                  review</b> of difficult PRs (as Steve Lee wrote recently, "if
                  literally all a developer did was review hard but important
                  PRs it'd be incredibly valuable").
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The idea is to unblock these critical PRs not only by
                      reviewing them, but also <b>coordinating</b> with the
                      maintainers and other contributors to ensure timely review
                      where it is most needed and difficult.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Reviewing also means continuing to find and fix
                      regressions and bugs throughout Bitcoin Core to make it
                      more <b>robust</b>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Increasing Bitcoin Core's <b>robustness</b>: finding and
                  fixing regressions and bugs, and adding missing test
                  coverage and better testing in under-utilised areas like
                  the P2P network, fuzzing, and
                  <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16645"
                     target="_blank">property-based testing</a> which I would
                     like to continue integrating into Bitcoin Core. Robustness
                     can also mean working on codebase performance, modularity
                     and multiprocess.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Improving the Bitcoin Core <b>wallet</b> features, user
                  (GUI) interface, RPC interface, connectivity with hardware
                  wallets, and security.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Strengthening Bitcoin
                    Core's <b>decentralization</b>, <b>censorship resistance</b>
                    and <b>privacy</b> by working on the <b>peer-to-peer network
                    privacy</b> and resistance to surveillance and attacks:
                    researching and proposing improvements, and collaborating
                    with and testing work by fellow developers and researchers.

                      V2 P2P message protocol with opportunistic encryption (BIP
                      324, BIP 150) by Jonas Schnelli, which was the subject of

                      Possibly different IP buckets per peer; each IP
                      would have its own AddrMan table and would confer to
                      ensure they don't have the same peer IPs, to avoid
                      IP poisoning e.g. flooding by attacker peers.

                      Package Relay, separating block relay from transaction
                      relay into 2 networks. Suhas Daftuar is working on this;
                      it will need extensive review and
                      improvements/counter-proposals.
